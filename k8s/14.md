* [Kube Prometheus Stack](#kube-prometheus-stack)  


## Kube Prometheus Stack
* **Prometheus Operator**: it connects prometheus with kubernetes, and simplifies management of prometheus stack when working with kubernetes
* **Prometheus**: time-series database, it stores metrics data and provides HTTP interface for requesting that data
* **Alertmanager**: as it follows from its name, Alertmanager manages alerts. It can recieve alert from multiple sources, remove duplicates, filter, group them, etc. Then it forwards alerts to another reciever
* **Prometheus node-exporter**: collects metrics from hosts and serves as a source of metrics for Prometheus. It collects only hardware and OS metrics.
* **Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics API**: Same as Prometheus node-exporter, but instead of hardware and OS metrics, it collects Kubernetes-specific metrics
* **kube-state-metrics**: generates additional custom metrics, which will be then collected by monitoring states of k8s objects (pods, nodes, deploymenys)
* **Grafana**: visual interface for this stack, with graphs, charts, custom dashboards, etc.
